## Working Documents

Maintain architecture documentation in `docs/architecture/`:

- `system-design.md` - Overall system architecture. Conceptual and high-level; avoid embedding full schemas or verbose configs. Link to specific technical decisions for further details.
- `technical-decisions.md` - Key technical choices (Architecture Decision Record) index with status and summary.
- `technical-decisions/` - Individual ADR files. ADRs capture decisions, context, and consequences, and reference Implementation Specs for concrete definitions.
- `implementation-specs/` - Implementation Specs with detailed technical definitions (DDL, indexes, triggers, API contracts). These are the single source of truth for technical details.
- `notes.md` - Technical analysis to be shared between sessions if necessary
