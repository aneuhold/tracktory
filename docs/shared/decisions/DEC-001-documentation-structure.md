# DEC-001 Project Documentation Structure

**Date**: 2025-09-03
**Decision Maker**: Prompt Engineer
**Stakeholders**: All team roles
**Status**: Implemented

## Context

Need for centralized documentation system to enable collaboration between chat modes and provide visibility to the developer. The initial approach of having all user stories and decisions in single large files would become unwieldy as the project grows.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Single README Files

All documentation in one large file per domain

- **Pros**: Simple, everything in one place, easy to find
- **Cons**: Hard to maintain, no clear ownership, becomes unwieldy quickly, difficult to track individual items

### Option B: Domain-specific Folders with Overview Files

Organized by team responsibility with overview + individual item files

- **Pros**: Clear ownership, scalable, organized by expertise, manageable file sizes
- **Cons**: More complex, requires coordination, more files to manage

### Option C: Feature-based Organization

Organized by product features rather than team roles

- **Pros**: Feature-focused, intuitive for development workflows
- **Cons**: Cross-cutting concerns difficult, unclear ownership, doesn't align with chat mode responsibilities

## Decision

Implement domain-specific folder structure under `docs/` with:

- Overview files for guidelines and indexes (e.g., `user-stories.md`)
- Individual folders for specific items (e.g., `user-stories/`, `decisions/`)
- Clear ownership and collaboration patterns between chat modes

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- Each chat mode has clear documentation responsibilities
- Cross-functional collaboration through shared documents
- Developer has visibility into all aspects of the project
- Documentation stays current through clear ownership
- Scalable as project grows - no single file becomes too large
- Easy to link to specific user stories or decisions

### Potential Challenges

- More files to manage and keep organized
- Need to maintain consistency across multiple files
- Requires discipline to update overview files when items are added/changed

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Create domain-specific folder structure
- [x] Create overview files with guidelines and templates
- [x] Create sample individual item files
- [x] Update chat modes to reference the new structure
- [ ] Update existing documentation to follow new patterns
- [ ] Establish maintenance workflows
