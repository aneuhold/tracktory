## Collaboration Patterns

### Document Ownership

- **Primary Owner**: Chat mode responsible for maintaining the document
- **Contributors**: Other modes that provide input or review
- **Reviewers**: Stakeholders who validate and approve changes

### Cross-References

Documents should reference related artifacts using relative links:

```markdown
See [User Stories](../product/user-stories.md) for detailed requirements.
Refer to [System Design](../architecture/system-design.md) for technical context.
```

### Version Control

- All documentation is version controlled with the codebase
- Major changes should include commit messages explaining the rationale
- Use conventional commit prefixes: `docs(product): add user story for authentication`

### Review Process

1. **Draft**: Initial document creation by primary owner
2. **Review**: Cross-functional review by relevant team members
3. **Approve**: Final approval and merge
4. **Update**: Ongoing maintenance and updates

## Document Templates

Each directory contains template files to ensure consistency:

- **Template files** end with `.template.md`
- **Active documents** follow established naming conventions
- **Archive** old versions in subdirectories when major changes occur

## Getting Started

1. **Product Strategist**: Start with `strategy/product-vision.md`
2. **Product Manager**: Create initial user stories in `product/user-stories.md`
3. **UX Designer**: Document user research in `design/user-research.md`
4. **Architect**: Define system design in `architecture/system-design.md`
5. **DevOps Engineer**: Plan infrastructure in `infrastructure/deployment-guide.md`
6. **QA Engineer**: Create test strategy in `quality/test-strategy.md`

## Maintenance

- **Weekly**: Review and update active documents
- **Sprint Planning**: Update backlog and requirements
- **Release**: Update release notes and deployment guides
- **Quarterly**: Review and refresh strategic documents
