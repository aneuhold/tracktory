# US-001: Project Initialization

**As a** developer  
**I want** a properly structured Go API project with development environment  
**So that** I can begin implementing features efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Go module initialized with appropriate naming
- [ ] Project directory structure follows Go best practices
- [ ] Local development environment runs via Docker Compose
- [ ] Environment variable configuration system in place
- [ ] Basic logging and error handling utilities
- [ ] Git repository properly configured with .gitignore
- [ ] Development documentation (README) created
- [ ] Code formatting and linting tools configured

## Project Structure

```
cmd/
├── api/          # API server entry point
└── migrate/      # Database migration tool
internal/
├── handlers/     # HTTP request handlers
├── models/       # Data models
├── services/     # Business logic
├── middleware/   # HTTP middleware
├── config/       # Configuration management
└── database/     # Database utilities
pkg/              # Publicly importable packages
docker/           # Docker configuration
migrations/       # Database migration files
```

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Go 1.21+ with modules
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Air for hot reloading during development
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [ ] Environment-based configuration (dev/test/prod)

## Technical Implementation

- **Architecture**: Follows [system design structure](../../architecture/system-design.md#go-service-architecture)
- **Technology Stack**: Based on [ADR-001: Technology Stack](../../architecture/technical-decisions/adr-001-technology-stack.md)
- **Runtime**: See [runtime packaging spec](../../architecture/implementation-specs/runtime-packaging.md)

## Status & Metadata

- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High (foundational)
- **Estimate**: 3 points
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Deliverable**: Runnable Go API project structure
