# US-003: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**As a** developer  
**I want** automated testing and deployment pipeline  
**So that** code changes are validated and deployed safely

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Automated tests run on pull requests
- [ ] Code linting and formatting checks
- [ ] Database migrations tested in CI environment
- [ ] Docker image building and pushing
- [ ] Deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Production deployment workflow (manual trigger initially)
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Testing Workflow (`test.yml`)

- [ ] Run on pull requests and main branch pushes
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL service for testing
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Execute Go tests with coverage
- [ ] Run linting (golangci-lint)
- [ ] Verify Docker image builds

### Deployment Workflow (`deploy.yml`)

- [ ] Build and push Docker image to registry
- [ ] Deploy to Google Cloud Run
- [ ] Run database migrations on target environment
- [ ] Health check verification after deployment
- [ ] Rollback capability if deployment fails

## Environment Management

- [ ] Development: Local Docker setup
- [ ] CI: GitHub Actions PostgreSQL service
- [ ] Staging: Cloud resources for testing
- [ ] Production: Full cloud infrastructure

## Security & Secrets

- [ ] GitHub repository secrets configured
- [ ] Service account keys for cloud deployment
- [ ] Database connection strings secured
- [ ] JWT secrets and API keys managed properly

## Technical Implementation

- **Deployment Guide**: Follow [deployment guide](../../infrastructure/deployment-guide.md)
- **Infrastructure**: Based on [cloud infrastructure blueprint](../../infrastructure/architecture.md)
- **Runtime**: Docker setup per [runtime packaging spec](../../architecture/implementation-specs/runtime-packaging.md)

## Status & Metadata

- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High (enables rapid iteration)
- **Estimate**: 5 points
- **Dependencies**: US-001 (project), US-002 (database)
- **Deliverable**: Working CI/CD pipeline with automated deployments
