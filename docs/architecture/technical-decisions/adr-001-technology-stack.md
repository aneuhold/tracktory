# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to select primary technologies for frontend and backend development.

## Decision

**Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router  
**Backend**: Go 1.21+ with Gin framework  
**Database**: PostgreSQL 15+  
**Infrastructure**: Docker containers on Kubernetes

## Rationale

### Next.js Selection

- **Mobile Performance**: Excellent optimization for mobile devices
- **PWA Support**: Built-in service worker and offline capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript support, hot reloading, modern React patterns
- **SEO Capabilities**: Server-side rendering for better discoverability
- **Bundle Optimization**: Automatic code splitting and tree shaking

### Go Backend Selection

- **Performance**: Excellent performance characteristics for API servers
- **Concurrency**: Built-in goroutines for handling concurrent requests
- **Memory Efficiency**: Low memory footprint compared to Node.js/Python
- **Deployment**: Single binary deployment simplifies operations
- **Ecosystem**: Mature libraries for web APIs, database access, image processing

### PostgreSQL Selection

- **Full-Text Search**: Built-in search capabilities with tsvector
- **JSON Support**: JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- **Performance**: Excellent query optimization and indexing
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance and robust data integrity
- **Scalability**: Support for read replicas and partitioning

## Alternatives Considered

### Frontend Alternatives

- **React SPA**: Rejected due to SEO and initial load performance concerns
- **Vue.js/Nuxt**: Rejected due to smaller ecosystem and team familiarity
- **Svelte/SvelteKit**: Rejected due to smaller ecosystem and production maturity

### Backend Alternatives

- **Node.js/Express**: Rejected due to single-threaded performance limitations
- **Python/FastAPI**: Rejected due to deployment complexity and memory usage
- **Rust/Actix**: Rejected due to development velocity and team expertise

### Database Alternatives

- **MongoDB**: Rejected due to consistency concerns and search limitations
- **SQLite**: Rejected due to concurrent access limitations
- **MySQL**: Rejected due to full-text search limitations

## Consequences

### Positive

- High performance on mobile devices
- Excellent developer experience and productivity
- Strong ecosystem support and community
- Predictable scaling characteristics

### Negative

- Learning curve for Go if team is unfamiliar
- Next.js complexity for simple use cases
- PostgreSQL operational overhead vs. managed solutions

## Implementation Notes

- Use Next.js App Router for better performance and developer experience
- Implement Go APIs following standard REST conventions
- Set up PostgreSQL with proper indexing for full-text search
- Use Docker for consistent development and deployment environments
